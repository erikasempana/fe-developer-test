This problem is a classic logical illusion â€” no money is actually missing; it is a trick of reasoning.

Initial total money: $30
- Paid to the cashier: $25
- Change received: $5
  - Given to the homeless man: $2
  - Divided among the three friends: $3 ($1 each)

So each person effectively paid $9:
$9 x 3 = $27
From that $27:
- $25 went to the cashier
- $2 went to the homeless man

There is no need to add the $2 to the $27 again, because the $2 is already included in the $27.

The logical fallacy occurs when people try to add the $2 (already part of the $27) to $27 again and expect $30.

**Conclusion:** No money is missing, and there is no thief. It's just a misdirection in how the math is presented.
